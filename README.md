# LEGO-Design-Maker-Drawer-Robot-Project

The LEGO Design Maker Drawer Robot is a creative and innovative project built using LEGO robotics components. This robot is designed to function as an automated drawing assistant, capable of creating unique designs or patterns based on user input or pre-programmed instructions. The project combines mechanical design, robotics, and programming to deliver an engaging and functional tool for artistic or educational purposes.


# Key Features
Automated Drawing: The robot can draw designs, shapes, or patterns on paper with precision.
LEGO-based Construction: Built entirely using LEGO bricks and motors, making it modular, flexible, and easy to customize.
Programmable Behavior: Controlled using a programmable interface, allowing users to upload custom drawing instructions.
User Interaction: Can be operated interactively, where users input their desired designs, or autonomously with pre-set designs.

# Technical Details
## Hardware:
LEGO Mindstorms or similar LEGO robotics kit.
Motors and gears for precise control of movement.
Pen holder mechanism to hold and maneuver a drawing tool.
Baseplate or drawing surface for stability during operation.
## Programming:

Uses a LEGO-compatible programming platform such as the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 software, Scratch, or Python (via EV3Dev).
Commands are sent to control the robot's arm and wheels for drawing smooth curves or sharp angles.
## Mechanics:
The robot uses a combination of rotational and linear movements to create designs.
Gears and linkages ensure smooth and accurate control of the pen's position.
